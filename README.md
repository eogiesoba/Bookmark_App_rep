#Purpose
Bookmarks is an application that makes a copy of your Google Chrome bookmarks an organizes them in a personal library.  

#Summary

Our Bookmark App initially asks you to log in via a Chrome Extension using your existing email address. This allows our application to copy over your Chrome Bookmarks for display o the Bookmark App homepage. You will also be able to add new bookmarks to your library using this same Chrome extension.

Once you one log in from the Chrome extension, press the 'To Bookmark Home' button and you are directed accordingly. A modal will pop up asking you to confirm your email one more time. You will then see your bookmarks. You can visit the web page for the bookmark by clicking the link icon in the middle of the bookmark.

By clicking the 'Folder Bar' button in the upper left hand corner of the page, a list of Folders is revealed. You can assign a folder to a bookmark by dragging the folder line over to the green section on the bookmark. You can see all of the bookmarks assigned to a specific folder by clicking on the folder's line. 

That is all there is to it!
